# Blinkit Sales Data Analysis & Dashboard

This project performs an in-depth analysis of Blinkit's sales data to uncover key business insights. The raw data was pre-processed using Python to handle missing values and standardize formats. SQL queries were then used to analyze sales performance across various dimensions, including product categories, fat content, outlet size, location, and establishment year. Finally, an interactive dashboard was created in Power BI to visualize the findings, highlighting total sales of $1.20M, top-performing product types, and a strong customer preference for low-fat items.
